# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Implemented Card D3 Receipt Sequence Allocation in `pos-server` and `pos-api`.
- Added migration `V13__receipt_sequence_allocation.sql` with `receipt_series`, `receipt_sequence`, and `receipt_header` including uniqueness on `(series_id, number)` and `receipt_number`.
- Added receipt allocation API contract and endpoint: `POST /api/receipts/allocate`.
- Added concurrency-safe sequence allocation and immutable formatted receipt number generation per terminal series.
- Added authorization rule requiring `SALES_PROCESS` permission for receipt allocation.
- Added integration coverage for sequential receipt allocation, permission denial behavior, and concurrent duplicate-free allocation.
- Implemented Card A3 Security Foundation in `pos-server`.
- Added auth schema/migration (`V2__security_foundation.sql`) with `user_account`, role/permission mapping, session, and auth audit tables.
- Added stateless auth endpoints: `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/refresh`, `POST /api/auth/logout`.
- Added password hashing, failed-login lockout policy, and token/session validation.
- Added protected context endpoint `GET /api/security/me` and auth lifecycle integration tests.
- Implemented Card B2 Permission Matrix and Enforcement in `pos-server` and `pos-api`.
- Added migration `V4__permission_matrix_and_enforcement.sql` with baseline permission catalog and role-permission mappings.
- Added role and permission APIs: `GET /api/security/permissions/current`, `GET /api/security/permissions/catalog`, `GET/POST /api/security/roles`, and `PUT /api/security/roles/{id}/permissions`.
- Added explicit permission enforcement for sales, refunds, inventory adjustments, reports, and configuration operations with stable `POS-4030` denial contract.
- Added permission matrix integration tests and permission evaluator unit tests.
- Implemented Card B3 Shift and Cash Session Lifecycle in `pos-server` and `pos-api`.
- Added migration `V5__shift_and_cash_session_lifecycle.sql` with `cash_shift` and `cash_movement` tables plus finite-state/consistency checks.
- Added shift APIs: `POST /api/shifts/open`, `POST /api/shifts/{id}/cash-movements`, `POST /api/shifts/{id}/close`, and `GET /api/shifts/{id}` for expected vs counted reconciliation.
- Enforced one open shift per cashier+terminal, deterministic close variance calculation, and sales-permission protection for `/api/shifts/**`.
- Added state transition unit tests, lifecycle integration tests, and a concurrency race test for open-shift creation.
- Implemented Card C1 Product and Variant Core in `pos-server` and `pos-api`.
- Added migration `V6__product_and_variant_core.sql` with `category`, `product`, `product_variant`, and `product_barcode` tables including merchant-scoped SKU uniqueness and barcode lookup indexes.
- Added catalog APIs: `POST/GET/PUT /api/catalog/products`, `GET /api/catalog/products/{id}`, activation endpoints, and `GET /api/catalog/products/lookup`.
- Added barcode lookup authorization split: lookup supports `SALES_PROCESS` (and configuration admins), while catalog management remains `CONFIGURATION_MANAGE`.
- Added catalog integration tests for CRUD/list/lookup flows and repository constraint tests for duplicate SKU enforcement.
- Implemented Card C2 Category and Department Taxonomy in `pos-server` and `pos-api`.
- Added migration `V7__category_department_taxonomy.sql` introducing hierarchical categories with `parent_id` and integrity constraints.
- Added category hierarchy APIs: `GET /api/catalog/categories/tree` and `POST /api/catalog/categories/{id}/reparent`.
- Enforced cycle-safe reparenting and blocked new product assignments to inactive categories.
- Added tree-validation unit tests and hierarchy/product-assignment integration tests.
